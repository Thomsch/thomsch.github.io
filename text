            <p>I'm a software engineer who graduated from the
                <a href="http://www.heig-vd.ch/">HEIG-VD</a>. Then, I took 1 year to full-fill my duty as a Swiss citizen and work
                as a software engineer volunteer for
                <a href="http://www.digger.ch/">Digger</a>. This experience changed my life : I discovered the world of charities
                &amp; foundations and I used and adapted my skills to use them in the demanding
                world of work rather than in the cosy &amp; quit of university.</p>

            <p>I learned a lot of skills through university, work experience and personal
                interests. Here is a quick list to give you an idea:</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Skill</strong>: Design Pattern, Scrum, Agile, Machine Learning, Bioinformatics,
                Artificial Life, Data Science, Unity, IT</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Language</strong>: Java, Swing, C#, Haskell, R, Python, SQL, C++, HTML,
                CSS, PHP, JavaScript, C, Assembly</p>
            <p>Currently I'm learning Scala and I'm developing a project to learn JavaFx.</p>

                <strong>Evolution et vie artificielles</strong>
            </p>
            <p>The aim of this work was to create a tool to study the evolution of artiﬁcial
                life. The majority of the project was to design and develop a 3D physical
                simulator and its associated viewer. The other part of this work is to
                use the simulator to study the evolution of artiﬁcial life. As part of
                the simulation, he main element to describe the observed performance of
                an organization is the distance it has traveled during its existence. This
                criterion translates into practice by the fact that the more a body moves,
                the more likely it is to reproduce and pass on their genetic material to
                the future population. Thus mobility and reproductive success relate creating
                a selection pressure to the eﬃciency in the movements and, accordingly,
                on the anatomy of the organisms.</p>
            <p>For this project, the Unity framework was used. Once the simulator has
                been developed, several experiments were conducted to observe the behavior
                of simulated organisms. The results seem to conﬁrm the premise. We can
                observe that the anatomy of the organisms is changing and these changes
                lead to an increase in the distance and an increase in the number of reproductions
                by individual. The experiments described in this paper are just a glimpse
                of what the simulator is capable of doing. There are still many interesting
                avenues to explore.</p>
            <p>This project represent 420 hours of work. It was the project of my final
                year of Bachelor. It got the maximum grade and was awarded a prize.</p>
