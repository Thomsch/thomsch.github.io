{"name":"Thomsch.GitHub.io","tagline":"User's website","body":"### About me\r\nI'm a software engineer who graduated from the [HEIG-VD](http://www.heig-vd.ch/).\r\nThen, I took 1 year to full-fill my duty as a Swiss citizen and work as a software engineer volunteer for [Digger](http://www.digger.ch/). This experience changed my life : I discovered the world of charities & foundations and I used and adapted my skills to use them in the demanding world of work rather than in the cosy & quit of university.\r\n\r\n### I know those things\r\nI learned a lot of skills through university, work experience and personal interests. Here is a quick list to give you an idea:\r\n\r\n**Skill**: Design Pattern, Scrum, Agile, Machine Learning, Bioinformatics, Artificial Life, Data Science, Unity, IT\r\n**Language**: Java, Swing, C#, Haskell, R, Python, SQL, C++, HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, C, Assembly\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm learning Scala and I'm developing a project to learn JavaFx.\r\n\r\n### Some projects\r\n\r\n**Evolution et vie artificielles**\r\nThe aim of this work was to create a tool to study the evolution of artiﬁcial life. The majority of the project was to design and develop a 3D physical simulator and its associated viewer. The other part of this work is to use the simulator to study the evolution of artiﬁcial life. As part of the simulation, he main element to describe the observed performance of an organization is the distance it has traveled during its existence. This criterion translates into practice by the fact that the more a body moves, the more likely it is to reproduce and pass on their genetic material to the future population. Thus mobility and reproductive success relate creating a selection pressure to the eﬃciency in the movements and, accordingly, on the anatomy of the organisms. \r\n \r\nFor this project, the Unity framework was used. Once the simulator has been developed, several experiments were conducted to observe the behavior of simulated organisms. The results seem to conﬁrm the premise. We can observe that the anatomy of the organisms is changing and these changes lead to an increase in the distance and an increase in the number of reproductions by individual. The experiments described in this paper are just a glimpse of what the simulator is capable of doing. There are still many interesting avenues to explore.\r\n\r\nThis project represent 420 hours of work. It was the project of my final year of Bachelor. It got the maximum grade and was awarded a prize.\r\n\r\nYou can check it out on github [here](https://github.com/Thomsch/EVA).\r\n\r\n**Others projects**\r\nI have other projects, you can check them out on my github [here](https://github.com/Thomsch) or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tschweizer).\r\n\r\n### Awards and achievements\r\nThe complete list is available on my resume or on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tschweizer)\r\n\r\n### Contact me \r\nYou can use github or linkedin to contact me.\r\n\r\nLast updated on 22/02/2016","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
